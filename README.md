# Workshops/Exercises for CSS for JS

Contains directories that correspond to the repositories for workshops/exercises of [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau)'s excellent course, [CSS for JS](https://css-for-js.dev/).

Each workshop/exercise is its own repository. Forking each one clutters my repositories page.

Instead of forking each workshop's repo to add my changes, I'm manually adding directory for each module's workshop/exercise.
